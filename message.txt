Bubba, I can’t stop smiling knowing you said yes! I guess the program I made really worked, the ‘no’ button was running away. But honestly, even without a runaway button, I would’ve asked a thousand times and still hoped you’d say yes. This being our second Valentine’s Day together makes it even more special because we’ve already shared so many amazing memories, laughs, and little moments that mean the world to me. I feel so lucky to have you, Saira, as my love, my safe place, and my favorite person in the world.

Thank you for trusting me, for loving me, and for letting me love you back with everything I have. I promise, Bubba, to always make you smile, laugh, and feel cherished every single day. I can’t wait for more cuddles, more adventures, and more memories with you. Happy second Valentine’s Day. I love you more than words could ever capture. ❤️
